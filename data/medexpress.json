						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat dental issues, such as tooth aches?",

In order to ensure individuals receive the highest-quality care and treatment, all individuals seeking care at MedExpress for known or suspected COVID-19 cases will receive an examination by a MedExpress health care professional who will determine if testing is needed and which testing method may be most appropriate, including rapid antigen and laboratory send-out PCR COVID-19 testing. \n\nPlease note that for the most accurate COVID-19 test results, the CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that individuals who are not showing symptoms, but who have had close contact with an individual who has tested positively for COVID-19, wait five to seven days after the known exposure to get a COVID-19 test. Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."

We do not currently accept referrals or prescriptions for testing from outside health care providers."
						},

							"question": "Does MedExpress offer a telehealth option?",
							"answer": "Yes, MedExpress is proud to offer patients the option of a Virtual Visit. Speak with one of our providers from the comfort of your home with secure video conferencing.

Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."

						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat patients of all ages, including infants?",

Depending on the presenting symptoms, infants need to be directed for further evaluation, but our team of clinicians can help to determine the best plan of treatment.

							"answer": "MedExpress treats a wide variety of injuries and illnesses, including sprains, flu, skin ailments – such as poison ivy and cellulitis – urinary tract infections, strep throat and more.

							"question": "Does MedExpress offer vaccines and immunizations?",
							"answer": "MedExpress offers many immunizations for adults, including the flu vaccine and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough vaccine); however, there are some regional variances in vaccine availability. It’s always best to call your local center first to see if the immunization you’re looking for is in stock. As for children, MedExpress does not provide routine child immunizations with the exception of annual flu shots (for children ages 4 and older) and tetanus shots (if needed due to an injury)."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat dental issues, such as tooth aches?",

						},

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat chronic conditions, such as diabetes?",
							"answer": "Our full medical team will gladly evaluate anyone in need of medical care and help decide the best plan of treatment. However, chronic medical conditions are best handled by a PCP, who can offer a long-term treatment plan. It’s always important to remember that if you think you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately."
						},

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide gynecology care?",
							"answer": "MedExpress does not provide routine gynecological or OB care, which includes conducting ultrasounds and prescribing birth control.

							"answer": "MedExpress can provide initial STD testing at all of our locations."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress make referrals to other healthcare providers?",
							"answer": "Yes. MedExpress can help with referrals to other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, specialists, and primary care physicians (PCPs), after treating you as a patient.

However, it’s important to know that we’re only able to provide referrals if our provider deems it appropriate for the patient’s condition."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can MedExpress write prescription refills?",

							"question": "What types of COVID-19 testing does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is offering COVID-19 evaluations and testing at designated centers to help support our local communities' health care needs amid the pandemic. In order to ensure individuals receive the highest-quality care and treatment, all individuals seeking care at MedExpress for known or suspected COVID-19 cases will receive an examination by a MedExpress health care professional who will determine if testing is needed and which testing method may be most appropriate, including rapid antigen and laboratory send-out PCR COVID-19 testing. \n\nPlease note that for the most accurate COVID-19 test results, the CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that individuals who are not showing symptoms, but who have had close contact with an individual who has tested positively for COVID-19, wait five to seven days after the known exposure to get a COVID-19 test. Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."
						},
						{
							"question": "Do I need a doctor’s referral to be tested for COVID-19 at a MedExpress center?",
							"answer": "No, you do not need a referral from your doctor to be tested. Please note, however, that COVID-19 testing is only available at designated MedExpress COVID-19 testing locations for patients who are seen and evaluated at our centers. We do not currently accept referrals or prescriptions for testing from outside health care providers."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer a telehealth option?",
							"answer": "Yes, MedExpress is proud to offer patients the option of a Virtual Visit. Speak with one of our providers from the comfort of your home with secure video conferencing. All appointments subject to availability. Patients must be physically located in states where service offering is available in order to utilize this service.

						},
						{
							"question": "How much does a typical visit to MedExpress cost?",

						},
						{
							"question": "What insurance does MedExpress accept?",
							"answer": "MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs, but in-network plans can vary by location. For additional information regarding your specific plan and coverage, such as co-pays, deductibles, or co-insurance, please contact your insurance provider directly."

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat patients of all ages, including infants?",
							"answer": "MedExpress’ providers will evaluate and treat patients of all ages, including infants. Depending on the presenting symptoms, infants need to be directed for further evaluation, but our team of clinicians can help to determine the best plan of treatment. While MedExpress will evaluate anyone – regardless of age – who visits one of our centers, our providers may decline to treat infants (6 months or younger) and refer them back to their pediatrician or ER, where they can receive the best possible care."
						},
						{
							"question": "What type of services and treatment options does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress treats a wide variety of injuries and illnesses, including sprains, flu, skin ailments – such as poison ivy and cellulitis – urinary tract infections, strep throat and more. Our centers have the necessary equipment onsite to provide top quality care.

For a complete list of all our offerings, please visit our website."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer vaccines and immunizations?",
							"answer": "MedExpress offers many immunizations for adults, including the flu vaccine and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough vaccine); however, there are some regional variances in vaccine availability. It’s always best to call your local center first to see if the immunization you’re looking for is in stock. As for children, MedExpress does not provide routine child immunizations with the exception of annual flu shots (for children ages 4 and older) and tetanus shots (if needed due to an injury)."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat dental issues, such as tooth aches?",
							"answer": "For dental pain and tooth aches, our providers can evaluate you and may prescribe antibiotics, if needed. From there, we can refer you to a dentist, as they are the best professionals to consult for any dental needs."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress conduct eye examinations?",
							"answer": "Our providers do not prescribe glasses or contacts. However, our full medical team can help with eye-related illness or injuries, such as pink eye. If further specialized treatment is needed, we can refer you to an eye specialist."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat chronic conditions, such as diabetes?",
							"answer": "Our full medical team will gladly evaluate anyone in need of medical care and help decide the best plan of treatment. However, chronic medical conditions are best handled by a PCP, who can offer a long-term treatment plan. It’s always important to remember that if you think you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer physicals?",
							"answer": "MedExpress provides convenient and affordable physicals for a variety of reasons, including school physicals, sports physicals, daycare physicals, DOT physicals and work-related physicals.

						},

							"question": "Does MedExpress provide mental health services?",
							"answer": "If you’ve visited us as a patient, MedExpress can help make a mental health referral for new symptoms, but we also encourage you to reach out to community resources. If you have insurance, the 1-800 number on the back of your card will connect you with someone who can help with in-network referrals."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide gynecology care?",
							"answer": "MedExpress does not provide routine gynecological or OB care, which includes conducting ultrasounds and prescribing birth control. However, we can conduct pregnancy testing after a medical evaluation and provide medical treatment to pregnant women who are being seen for a minor illness or injury."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer STD/STI testing?",
							"answer": "MedExpress can provide initial STD testing at all of our locations."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress make referrals to other healthcare providers?",
							"answer": "Yes. MedExpress can help with referrals to other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, specialists, and primary care physicians (PCPs), after treating you as a patient. We want to make sure our patients get the follow-up care they need. However, it’s important to know that we’re only able to provide referrals if our provider deems it appropriate for the patient’s condition."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can MedExpress write prescription refills?",
							"answer": "Prescriptions require a visit with one of our providers, and we may potentially prescribe limited prescription refills. However, we cannot provide refill prescriptions for controlled substances or birth control."
						},
						{
							"question": "What types of COVID-19 testing does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is offering COVID-19 evaluations and testing at designated centers to help support our local communities' health care needs amid the pandemic. In order to ensure individuals receive the highest-quality care and treatment, all individuals seeking care at MedExpress for known or suspected COVID-19 cases will receive an examination by a MedExpress health care professional who will determine if testing is needed and which testing method may be most appropriate, including rapid antigen and laboratory send-out PCR COVID-19 testing. \n\nPlease note that for the most accurate COVID-19 test results, the CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that individuals who are not showing symptoms, but who have had close contact with an individual who has tested positively for COVID-19, wait five to seven days after the known exposure to get a COVID-19 test. Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."
						},
						{
							"question": "Do I need a doctor’s referral to be tested for COVID-19 at a MedExpress center?",
							"answer": "No, you do not need a referral from your doctor to be tested. Please note, however, that COVID-19 testing is only available at designated MedExpress COVID-19 testing locations for patients who are seen and evaluated at our centers. We do not currently accept referrals or prescriptions for testing from outside health care providers."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer a telehealth option?",
							"answer": "Yes, MedExpress is proud to offer patients the option of a Virtual Visit. Speak with one of our providers from the comfort of your home with secure video conferencing. All appointments subject to availability. Patients must be physically located in states where service offering is available in order to utilize this service. Please be advised that some illnesses and injuries are more appropriately treated in-person, and you may be asked to visit a MedExpress center in-person or directed to another health care provider or facility, when appropriate. Please visit our website to learn more about this offering."

We recommend that you visit our website to check your nearest center's listing for exact hours before visiting."
						},
						{
							"question": "How much does a typical visit to MedExpress cost?",
							"answer": "The cost of a visit to MedExpress varies based on the services you receive and the specifics of your insurance plan. MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs and also offers affordable pricing for those without insurance."
						},
						{
							"question": "What insurance does MedExpress accept?",
							"answer": "MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs, but in-network plans can vary by location. For additional information regarding your specific plan and coverage, such as co-pays, deductibles, or co-insurance, please contact your insurance provider directly."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can I still visit MedExpress if I don’t have insurance?",
							"answer": "Yes. For those without insurance, self-pay services start at $119 - $139. The price of self-pay services will depend on where your center is located."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress accept VA benefits?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is proud to be a VA authorized urgent care provider. If you opt for self-pay, you will be required to pay at the time of your visit either with cash, check, debit card or credit card. At this time, MedExpress does not accept CareCredit."

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat patients of all ages, including infants?",
							"answer": "MedExpress’ providers will evaluate and treat patients of all ages, including infants. Depending on the presenting symptoms, infants need to be directed for further evaluation, but our team of clinicians can help to determine the best plan of treatment. While MedExpress will evaluate anyone – regardless of age – who visits one of our centers, our providers may decline to treat infants (6 months or younger) and refer them back to their pediatrician or ER, where they can receive the best possible care."
						},
						{
							"question": "What type of services and treatment options does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress treats a wide variety of injuries and illnesses, including sprains, flu, skin ailments – such as poison ivy and cellulitis – urinary tract infections, strep throat and more. Our centers have the necessary equipment onsite to provide top quality care. If deemed necessary, our medical professionals can complete X-rays, laboratory services (such as strep tests and urinalysis), EKGs, stitches and more. For a complete list of all our offerings, please visit our website."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer vaccines and immunizations?",
							"answer": "MedExpress offers many immunizations for adults, including the flu vaccine and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough vaccine); however, there are some regional variances in vaccine availability. It’s always best to call your local center first to see if the immunization you’re looking for is in stock. As for children, MedExpress does not provide routine child immunizations with the exception of annual flu shots (for children ages 4 and older) and tetanus shots (if needed due to an injury)."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat dental issues, such as tooth aches?",
							"answer": "For dental pain and tooth aches, our providers can evaluate you and may prescribe antibiotics, if needed. From there, we can refer you to a dentist, as they are the best professionals to consult for any dental needs."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress conduct eye examinations?",
							"answer": "Our providers do not prescribe glasses or contacts. However, our full medical team can help with eye-related illness or injuries, such as pink eye. If further specialized treatment is needed, we can refer you to an eye specialist."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat chronic conditions, such as diabetes?",
							"answer": "Our full medical team will gladly evaluate anyone in need of medical care and help decide the best plan of treatment. However, chronic medical conditions are best handled by a PCP, who can offer a long-term treatment plan. It’s always important to remember that if you think you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer physicals?",
							"answer": "MedExpress provides convenient and affordable physicals for a variety of reasons, including school physicals, sports physicals, daycare physicals, DOT physicals and work-related physicals. Please visit our website for specific information related to your needs and availability in your area."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide mental health services?",
							"answer": "If you’ve visited us as a patient, MedExpress can help make a mental health referral for new symptoms, but we also encourage you to reach out to community resources. If you have insurance, the 1-800 number on the back of your card will connect you with someone who can help with in-network referrals."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide gynecology care?",
							"answer": "MedExpress does not provide routine gynecological or OB care, which includes conducting ultrasounds and prescribing birth control. However, we can conduct pregnancy testing after a medical evaluation and provide medical treatment to pregnant women who are being seen for a minor illness or injury."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer STD/STI testing?",
							"answer": "MedExpress can provide initial STD testing at all of our locations."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress make referrals to other healthcare providers?",
							"answer": "Yes. MedExpress can help with referrals to other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, specialists, and primary care physicians (PCPs), after treating you as a patient. We want to make sure our patients get the follow-up care they need. However, it’s important to know that we’re only able to provide referrals if our provider deems it appropriate for the patient’s condition."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can MedExpress write prescription refills?",
							"answer": "Prescriptions require a visit with one of our providers, and we may potentially prescribe limited prescription refills. However, we cannot provide refill prescriptions for controlled substances or birth control."
						},
						{
							"question": "What types of COVID-19 testing does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is offering COVID-19 evaluations and testing at designated centers to help support our local communities' health care needs amid the pandemic. In order to ensure individuals receive the highest-quality care and treatment, all individuals seeking care at MedExpress for known or suspected COVID-19 cases will receive an examination by a MedExpress health care professional who will determine if testing is needed and which testing method may be most appropriate, including rapid antigen and laboratory send-out PCR COVID-19 testing. \n\nPlease note that for the most accurate COVID-19 test results, the CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that individuals who are not showing symptoms, but who have had close contact with an individual who has tested positively for COVID-19, wait five to seven days after the known exposure to get a COVID-19 test. Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."
						},
						{
							"question": "Do I need a doctor’s referral to be tested for COVID-19 at a MedExpress center?",
							"answer": "No, you do not need a referral from your doctor to be tested. Please note, however, that COVID-19 testing is only available at designated MedExpress COVID-19 testing locations for patients who are seen and evaluated at our centers. We do not currently accept referrals or prescriptions for testing from outside health care providers."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer a telehealth option?",
							"answer": "Yes, MedExpress is proud to offer patients the option of a Virtual Visit. Speak with one of our providers from the comfort of your home with secure video conferencing. All appointments subject to availability. Patients must be physically located in states where service offering is available in order to utilize this service. Please be advised that some illnesses and injuries are more appropriately treated in-person, and you may be asked to visit a MedExpress center in-person or directed to another health care provider or facility, when appropriate. Please visit our website to learn more about this offering."

We recommend that you visit our website to check your nearest center's listing for exact hours before visiting."
						},
						{
							"question": "How much does a typical visit to MedExpress cost?",
							"answer": "The cost of a visit to MedExpress varies based on the services you receive and the specifics of your insurance plan. MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs and also offers affordable pricing for those without insurance."
						},
						{
							"question": "What insurance does MedExpress accept?",
							"answer": "MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs, but in-network plans can vary by location. For additional information regarding your specific plan and coverage, such as co-pays, deductibles, or co-insurance, please contact your insurance provider directly."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can I still visit MedExpress if I don’t have insurance?",

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress accept VA benefits?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is proud to be a VA authorized urgent care provider. If you opt for self-pay, you will be required to pay at the time of your visit either with cash, check, debit card or credit card. At this time, MedExpress does not accept CareCredit."

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat patients of all ages, including infants?",
							"answer": "MedExpress’ providers will evaluate and treat patients of all ages, including infants. Depending on the presenting symptoms, infants need to be directed for further evaluation, but our team of clinicians can help to determine the best plan of treatment. While MedExpress will evaluate anyone – regardless of age – who visits one of our centers, our providers may decline to treat infants (6 months or younger) and refer them back to their pediatrician or ER, where they can receive the best possible care."
						},
						{
							"question": "What type of services and treatment options does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress treats a wide variety of injuries and illnesses, including sprains, flu, skin ailments – such as poison ivy and cellulitis – urinary tract infections, strep throat and more. Our centers have the necessary equipment onsite to provide top quality care. If deemed necessary, our medical professionals can complete X-rays, laboratory services (such as strep tests and urinalysis), EKGs, stitches and more. For a complete list of all our offerings, please visit our website."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer vaccines and immunizations?",
							"answer": "MedExpress offers many immunizations for adults, including the flu vaccine and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough vaccine); however, there are some regional variances in vaccine availability. It’s always best to call your local center first to see if the immunization you’re looking for is in stock. As for children, MedExpress does not provide routine child immunizations with the exception of annual flu shots (for children ages 4 and older) and tetanus shots (if needed due to an injury)."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat dental issues, such as tooth aches?",
							"answer": "For dental pain and tooth aches, our providers can evaluate you and may prescribe antibiotics, if needed. From there, we can refer you to a dentist, as they are the best professionals to consult for any dental needs."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress conduct eye examinations?",
							"answer": "Our providers do not prescribe glasses or contacts. However, our full medical team can help with eye-related illness or injuries, such as pink eye. If further specialized treatment is needed, we can refer you to an eye specialist."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat chronic conditions, such as diabetes?",
							"answer": "Our full medical team will gladly evaluate anyone in need of medical care and help decide the best plan of treatment. However, chronic medical conditions are best handled by a PCP, who can offer a long-term treatment plan. It’s always important to remember that if you think you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer physicals?",
							"answer": "MedExpress provides convenient and affordable physicals for a variety of reasons, including school physicals, sports physicals, daycare physicals, DOT physicals and work-related physicals. Please visit our website for specific information related to your needs and availability in your area."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide mental health services?",
							"answer": "If you’ve visited us as a patient, MedExpress can help make a mental health referral for new symptoms, but we also encourage you to reach out to community resources. If you have insurance, the 1-800 number on the back of your card will connect you with someone who can help with in-network referrals."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide gynecology care?",
							"answer": "MedExpress does not provide routine gynecological or OB care, which includes conducting ultrasounds and prescribing birth control. However, we can conduct pregnancy testing after a medical evaluation and provide medical treatment to pregnant women who are being seen for a minor illness or injury."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer STD/STI testing?",
							"answer": "MedExpress can provide initial STD testing at all of our locations."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress make referrals to other healthcare providers?",
							"answer": "Yes. MedExpress can help with referrals to other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, specialists, and primary care physicians (PCPs), after treating you as a patient. We want to make sure our patients get the follow-up care they need. However, it’s important to know that we’re only able to provide referrals if our provider deems it appropriate for the patient’s condition."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can MedExpress write prescription refills?",
							"answer": "Prescriptions require a visit with one of our providers, and we may potentially prescribe limited prescription refills. However, we cannot provide refill prescriptions for controlled substances or birth control."
						},
						{
							"question": "What types of COVID-19 testing does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is offering COVID-19 evaluations and testing at designated centers to help support our local communities' health care needs amid the pandemic. In order to ensure individuals receive the highest-quality care and treatment, all individuals seeking care at MedExpress for known or suspected COVID-19 cases will receive an examination by a MedExpress health care professional who will determine if testing is needed and which testing method may be most appropriate, including rapid antigen and laboratory send-out PCR COVID-19 testing. \n\nPlease note that for the most accurate COVID-19 test results, the CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that individuals who are not showing symptoms, but who have had close contact with an individual who has tested positively for COVID-19, wait five to seven days after the known exposure to get a COVID-19 test. Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."
						},
						{
							"question": "Do I need a doctor’s referral to be tested for COVID-19 at a MedExpress center?",
							"answer": "No, you do not need a referral from your doctor to be tested. Please note, however, that COVID-19 testing is only available at designated MedExpress COVID-19 testing locations for patients who are seen and evaluated at our centers. We do not currently accept referrals or prescriptions for testing from outside health care providers."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer a telehealth option?",
							"answer": "Yes, MedExpress is proud to offer patients the option of a Virtual Visit. Speak with one of our providers from the comfort of your home with secure video conferencing. All appointments subject to availability. Patients must be physically located in states where service offering is available in order to utilize this service. Please be advised that some illnesses and injuries are more appropriately treated in-person, and you may be asked to visit a MedExpress center in-person or directed to another health care provider or facility, when appropriate. Please visit our website to learn more about this offering."

We recommend that you visit our website to check your nearest center's listing for exact hours before visiting."
						},
						{
							"question": "How much does a typical visit to MedExpress cost?",
							"answer": "The cost of a visit to MedExpress varies based on the services you receive and the specifics of your insurance plan. MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs and also offers affordable pricing for those without insurance."
						},
						{
							"question": "What insurance does MedExpress accept?",
							"answer": "MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs, but in-network plans can vary by location. For additional information regarding your specific plan and coverage, such as co-pays, deductibles, or co-insurance, please contact your insurance provider directly."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can I still visit MedExpress if I don’t have insurance?",

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress accept VA benefits?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is proud to be a VA authorized urgent care provider. If you opt for self-pay, you will be required to pay at the time of your visit either with cash, check, debit card or credit card. At this time, MedExpress does not accept CareCredit."

							"answer": "You can pay your bill online by visiting our Bill Pay Portal on our website. You’ll need to know your quick pay code, which is located on your patient statement at the top right of the page.

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat patients of all ages, including infants?",
							"answer": "MedExpress’ providers will evaluate and treat patients of all ages, including infants. Depending on the presenting symptoms, infants need to be directed for further evaluation, but our team of clinicians can help to determine the best plan of treatment. While MedExpress will evaluate anyone – regardless of age – who visits one of our centers, our providers may decline to treat infants (6 months or younger) and refer them back to their pediatrician or ER, where they can receive the best possible care."
						},
						{
							"question": "What type of services and treatment options does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress treats a wide variety of injuries and illnesses, including sprains, flu, skin ailments – such as poison ivy and cellulitis – urinary tract infections, strep throat and more. Our centers have the necessary equipment onsite to provide top quality care. If deemed necessary, our medical professionals can complete X-rays, laboratory services (such as strep tests and urinalysis), EKGs, stitches and more. For a complete list of all our offerings, please visit our website."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer vaccines and immunizations?",
							"answer": "MedExpress offers many immunizations for adults, including the flu vaccine and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough vaccine); however, there are some regional variances in vaccine availability. It’s always best to call your local center first to see if the immunization you’re looking for is in stock. As for children, MedExpress does not provide routine child immunizations with the exception of annual flu shots (for children ages 4 and older) and tetanus shots (if needed due to an injury)."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat dental issues, such as tooth aches?",
							"answer": "For dental pain and tooth aches, our providers can evaluate you and may prescribe antibiotics, if needed. From there, we can refer you to a dentist, as they are the best professionals to consult for any dental needs."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress conduct eye examinations?",
							"answer": "Our providers do not prescribe glasses or contacts. However, our full medical team can help with eye-related illness or injuries, such as pink eye. If further specialized treatment is needed, we can refer you to an eye specialist."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat chronic conditions, such as diabetes?",
							"answer": "Our full medical team will gladly evaluate anyone in need of medical care and help decide the best plan of treatment. However, chronic medical conditions are best handled by a PCP, who can offer a long-term treatment plan. It’s always important to remember that if you think you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer physicals?",
							"answer": "MedExpress provides convenient and affordable physicals for a variety of reasons, including school physicals, sports physicals, daycare physicals, DOT physicals and work-related physicals. Please visit our website for specific information related to your needs and availability in your area."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide mental health services?",
							"answer": "If you’ve visited us as a patient, MedExpress can help make a mental health referral for new symptoms, but we also encourage you to reach out to community resources. If you have insurance, the 1-800 number on the back of your card will connect you with someone who can help with in-network referrals."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide gynecology care?",
							"answer": "MedExpress does not provide routine gynecological or OB care, which includes conducting ultrasounds and prescribing birth control. However, we can conduct pregnancy testing after a medical evaluation and provide medical treatment to pregnant women who are being seen for a minor illness or injury."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer STD/STI testing?",
							"answer": "MedExpress can provide initial STD testing at all of our locations."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress make referrals to other healthcare providers?",
							"answer": "Yes. MedExpress can help with referrals to other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, specialists, and primary care physicians (PCPs), after treating you as a patient. We want to make sure our patients get the follow-up care they need. However, it’s important to know that we’re only able to provide referrals if our provider deems it appropriate for the patient’s condition."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can MedExpress write prescription refills?",
							"answer": "Prescriptions require a visit with one of our providers, and we may potentially prescribe limited prescription refills. However, we cannot provide refill prescriptions for controlled substances or birth control."
						},
						{
							"question": "What types of COVID-19 testing does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is offering COVID-19 evaluations and testing at designated centers to help support our local communities' health care needs amid the pandemic. In order to ensure individuals receive the highest-quality care and treatment, all individuals seeking care at MedExpress for known or suspected COVID-19 cases will receive an examination by a MedExpress health care professional who will determine if testing is needed and which testing method may be most appropriate, including rapid antigen and laboratory send-out PCR COVID-19 testing. \n\nPlease note that for the most accurate COVID-19 test results, the CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that individuals who are not showing symptoms, but who have had close contact with an individual who has tested positively for COVID-19, wait five to seven days after the known exposure to get a COVID-19 test. Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."
						},
						{
							"question": "Do I need a doctor’s referral to be tested for COVID-19 at a MedExpress center?",
							"answer": "No, you do not need a referral from your doctor to be tested. Please note, however, that COVID-19 testing is only available at designated MedExpress COVID-19 testing locations for patients who are seen and evaluated at our centers. We do not currently accept referrals or prescriptions for testing from outside health care providers."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer a telehealth option?",
							"answer": "Yes, MedExpress is proud to offer patients the option of a Virtual Visit. Speak with one of our providers from the comfort of your home with secure video conferencing. All appointments subject to availability. Patients must be physically located in states where service offering is available in order to utilize this service. Please be advised that some illnesses and injuries are more appropriately treated in-person, and you may be asked to visit a MedExpress center in-person or directed to another health care provider or facility, when appropriate. Please visit our website to learn more about this offering."

						},
						{
							"question": "How much does a typical visit to MedExpress cost?",
							"answer": "The cost of a visit to MedExpress varies based on the services you receive and the specifics of your insurance plan. MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs and also offers affordable pricing for those without insurance."
						},
						{
							"question": "What insurance does MedExpress accept?",
							"answer": "MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs, but in-network plans can vary by location. For additional information regarding your specific plan and coverage, such as co-pays, deductibles, or co-insurance, please contact your insurance provider directly."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can I still visit MedExpress if I don’t have insurance?",

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress accept VA benefits?",

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat patients of all ages, including infants?",
							"answer": "MedExpress’ providers will evaluate and treat patients of all ages, including infants. Depending on the presenting symptoms, infants need to be directed for further evaluation, but our team of clinicians can help to determine the best plan of treatment. While MedExpress will evaluate anyone – regardless of age – who visits one of our centers, our providers may decline to treat infants (6 months or younger) and refer them back to their pediatrician or ER, where they can receive the best possible care."
						},
						{
							"question": "What type of services and treatment options does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress treats a wide variety of injuries and illnesses, including sprains, flu, skin ailments – such as poison ivy and cellulitis – urinary tract infections, strep throat and more. Our centers have the necessary equipment onsite to provide top quality care.

For a complete list of all our offerings, please visit our website."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer vaccines and immunizations?",
							"answer": "MedExpress offers many immunizations for adults, including the flu vaccine and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough vaccine); however, there are some regional variances in vaccine availability. It’s always best to call your local center first to see if the immunization you’re looking for is in stock. As for children, MedExpress does not provide routine child immunizations with the exception of annual flu shots (for children ages 4 and older) and tetanus shots (if needed due to an injury)."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat dental issues, such as tooth aches?",
							"answer": "For dental pain and tooth aches, our providers can evaluate you and may prescribe antibiotics, if needed. From there, we can refer you to a dentist, as they are the best professionals to consult for any dental needs."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress conduct eye examinations?",
							"answer": "Our providers do not prescribe glasses or contacts. However, our full medical team can help with eye-related illness or injuries, such as pink eye. If further specialized treatment is needed, we can refer you to an eye specialist."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat chronic conditions, such as diabetes?",
							"answer": "Our full medical team will gladly evaluate anyone in need of medical care and help decide the best plan of treatment. However, chronic medical conditions are best handled by a PCP, who can offer a long-term treatment plan. It’s always important to remember that if you think you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer physicals?",
							"answer": "MedExpress provides convenient and affordable physicals for a variety of reasons, including school physicals, sports physicals, daycare physicals, DOT physicals and work-related physicals.

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide mental health services?",
							"answer": "If you’ve visited us as a patient, MedExpress can help make a mental health referral for new symptoms, but we also encourage you to reach out to community resources. If you have insurance, the 1-800 number on the back of your card will connect you with someone who can help with in-network referrals."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide gynecology care?",
							"answer": "MedExpress does not provide routine gynecological or OB care, which includes conducting ultrasounds and prescribing birth control. However, we can conduct pregnancy testing after a medical evaluation and provide medical treatment to pregnant women who are being seen for a minor illness or injury."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer STD/STI testing?",
							"answer": "MedExpress can provide initial STD testing at all of our locations."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress make referrals to other healthcare providers?",
							"answer": "Yes. MedExpress can help with referrals to other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, specialists, and primary care physicians (PCPs), after treating you as a patient. We want to make sure our patients get the follow-up care they need. However, it’s important to know that we’re only able to provide referrals if our provider deems it appropriate for the patient’s condition."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can MedExpress write prescription refills?",

						},
						{
							"question": "What types of COVID-19 testing does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is offering COVID-19 evaluations and testing at designated centers to help support our local communities' health care needs amid the pandemic. In order to ensure individuals receive the highest-quality care and treatment, all individuals seeking care at MedExpress for known or suspected COVID-19 cases will receive an examination by a MedExpress health care professional who will determine if testing is needed and which testing method may be most appropriate, including rapid antigen and laboratory send-out PCR COVID-19 testing. \n\nPlease note that for the most accurate COVID-19 test results, the CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that individuals who are not showing symptoms, but who have had close contact with an individual who has tested positively for COVID-19, wait five to seven days after the known exposure to get a COVID-19 test. Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."
						},
						{
							"question": "Do I need a doctor’s referral to be tested for COVID-19 at a MedExpress center?",
							"answer": "No, you do not need a referral from your doctor to be tested. Please note, however, that COVID-19 testing is only available at designated MedExpress COVID-19 testing locations for patients who are seen and evaluated at our centers. We do not currently accept referrals or prescriptions for testing from outside health care providers."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer a telehealth option?",
							"answer": "Yes, MedExpress is proud to offer patients the option of a Virtual Visit. Speak with one of our providers from the comfort of your home with secure video conferencing. All appointments subject to availability. Patients must be physically located in states where service offering is available in order to utilize this service. Please be advised that some illnesses and injuries are more appropriately treated in-person, and you may be asked to visit a MedExpress center in-person or directed to another health care provider or facility, when appropriate. Please visit our website to learn more about this offering."

						},
						{
							"question": "How much does a typical visit to MedExpress cost?",
							"answer": "The cost of a visit to MedExpress varies based on the services you receive and the specifics of your insurance plan. MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs and also offers affordable pricing for those without insurance."
						},
						{
							"question": "What insurance does MedExpress accept?",
							"answer": "MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs, but in-network plans can vary by location. For additional information regarding your specific plan and coverage, such as co-pays, deductibles, or co-insurance, please contact your insurance provider directly."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can I still visit MedExpress if I don’t have insurance?",

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress accept VA benefits?",

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat patients of all ages, including infants?",
							"answer": "MedExpress’ providers will evaluate and treat patients of all ages, including infants. Depending on the presenting symptoms, infants need to be directed for further evaluation, but our team of clinicians can help to determine the best plan of treatment. While MedExpress will evaluate anyone – regardless of age – who visits one of our centers, our providers may decline to treat infants (6 months or younger) and refer them back to their pediatrician or ER, where they can receive the best possible care."
						},
						{
							"question": "What type of services and treatment options does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress treats a wide variety of injuries and illnesses, including sprains, flu, skin ailments – such as poison ivy and cellulitis – urinary tract infections, strep throat and more. Our centers have the necessary equipment onsite to provide top quality care.

For a complete list of all our offerings, please visit our website."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer vaccines and immunizations?",
							"answer": "MedExpress offers many immunizations for adults, including the flu vaccine and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough vaccine); however, there are some regional variances in vaccine availability. It’s always best to call your local center first to see if the immunization you’re looking for is in stock. As for children, MedExpress does not provide routine child immunizations with the exception of annual flu shots (for children ages 4 and older) and tetanus shots (if needed due to an injury)."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat dental issues, such as tooth aches?",
							"answer": "For dental pain and tooth aches, our providers can evaluate you and may prescribe antibiotics, if needed. From there, we can refer you to a dentist, as they are the best professionals to consult for any dental needs."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress conduct eye examinations?",
							"answer": "Our providers do not prescribe glasses or contacts. However, our full medical team can help with eye-related illness or injuries, such as pink eye. If further specialized treatment is needed, we can refer you to an eye specialist."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat chronic conditions, such as diabetes?",
							"answer": "Our full medical team will gladly evaluate anyone in need of medical care and help decide the best plan of treatment. However, chronic medical conditions are best handled by a PCP, who can offer a long-term treatment plan. It’s always important to remember that if you think you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer physicals?",

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide mental health services?",
							"answer": "If you’ve visited us as a patient, MedExpress can help make a mental health referral for new symptoms, but we also encourage you to reach out to community resources.

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide gynecology care?",
							"answer": "MedExpress does not provide routine gynecological or OB care, which includes conducting ultrasounds and prescribing birth control. However, we can conduct pregnancy testing after a medical evaluation and provide medical treatment to pregnant women who are being seen for a minor illness or injury."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer STD/STI testing?",
							"answer": "MedExpress can provide initial STD testing at all of our locations."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress make referrals to other healthcare providers?",
							"answer": "Yes. MedExpress can help with referrals to other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, specialists, and primary care physicians (PCPs), after treating you as a patient. We want to make sure our patients get the follow-up care they need. However, it’s important to know that we’re only able to provide referrals if our provider deems it appropriate for the patient’s condition."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can MedExpress write prescription refills?",

						},
						{
							"question": "What types of COVID-19 testing does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is offering COVID-19 evaluations and testing at designated centers to help support our local communities' health care needs amid the pandemic. In order to ensure individuals receive the highest-quality care and treatment, all individuals seeking care at MedExpress for known or suspected COVID-19 cases will receive an examination by a MedExpress health care professional who will determine if testing is needed and which testing method may be most appropriate, including rapid antigen and laboratory send-out PCR COVID-19 testing. \n\nPlease note that for the most accurate COVID-19 test results, the CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that individuals who are not showing symptoms, but who have had close contact with an individual who has tested positively for COVID-19, wait five to seven days after the known exposure to get a COVID-19 test. Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."
						},
						{
							"question": "Do I need a doctor’s referral to be tested for COVID-19 at a MedExpress center?",
							"answer": "No, you do not need a referral from your doctor to be tested. Please note, however, that COVID-19 testing is only available at designated MedExpress COVID-19 testing locations for patients who are seen and evaluated at our centers. We do not currently accept referrals or prescriptions for testing from outside health care providers."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer a telehealth option?",
							"answer": "Yes, MedExpress is proud to offer patients the option of a Virtual Visit. Speak with one of our providers from the comfort of your home with secure video conferencing. All appointments subject to availability. Patients must be physically located in states where service offering is available in order to utilize this service. Please be advised that some illnesses and injuries are more appropriately treated in-person, and you may be asked to visit a MedExpress center in-person or directed to another health care provider or facility, when appropriate. Please visit our website to learn more about this offering."

						},
						{
							"question": "How much does a typical visit to MedExpress cost?",
							"answer": "The cost of a visit to MedExpress varies based on the services you receive and the specifics of your insurance plan. MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs and also offers affordable pricing for those without insurance."
						},
						{
							"question": "What insurance does MedExpress accept?",
							"answer": "MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs, but in-network plans can vary by location. For additional information regarding your specific plan and coverage, such as co-pays, deductibles, or co-insurance, please contact your insurance provider directly."

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat patients of all ages, including infants?",
							"answer": "MedExpress’ providers will evaluate and treat patients of all ages, including infants. Depending on the presenting symptoms, infants need to be directed for further evaluation, but our team of clinicians can help to determine the best plan of treatment. While MedExpress will evaluate anyone – regardless of age – who visits one of our centers, our providers may decline to treat infants (6 months or younger) and refer them back to their pediatrician or ER, where they can receive the best possible care."
						},

							"answer": "MedExpress treats a wide variety of injuries and illnesses, including sprains, flu, skin ailments – such as poison ivy and cellulitis – urinary tract infections, strep throat and more.

						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer vaccines and immunizations?",
							"answer": "MedExpress offers many immunizations for adults, including the flu vaccine and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough vaccine); however, there are some regional variances in vaccine availability. It’s always best to call your local center first to see if the immunization you’re looking for is in stock. As for children, MedExpress does not provide routine child immunizations with the exception of annual flu shots (for children ages 4 and older) and tetanus shots (if needed due to an injury)."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat dental issues, such as tooth aches?",
							"answer": "For dental pain and tooth aches, our providers can evaluate you and may prescribe antibiotics, if needed. From there, we can refer you to a dentist, as they are the best professionals to consult for any dental needs."
						},

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat chronic conditions, such as diabetes?",
							"answer": "Our full medical team will gladly evaluate anyone in need of medical care and help decide the best plan of treatment. However, chronic medical conditions are best handled by a PCP, who can offer a long-term treatment plan. It’s always important to remember that if you think you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately."
						},

						},

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer STD/STI testing?",
							"answer": "MedExpress can provide initial STD testing at all of our locations."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress make referrals to other healthcare providers?",
							"answer": "Yes. MedExpress can help with referrals to other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, specialists, and primary care physicians (PCPs), after treating you as a patient. We want to make sure our patients get the follow-up care they need. However, it’s important to know that we’re only able to provide referrals if our provider deems it appropriate for the patient’s condition."
						},

							"question": "What types of COVID-19 testing does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is offering COVID-19 evaluations and testing at designated centers to help support our local communities' health care needs amid the pandemic. In order to ensure individuals receive the highest-quality care and treatment, all individuals seeking care at MedExpress for known or suspected COVID-19 cases will receive an examination by a MedExpress health care professional who will determine if testing is needed and which testing method may be most appropriate, including rapid antigen and laboratory send-out PCR COVID-19 testing. \n\nPlease note that for the most accurate COVID-19 test results, the CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that individuals who are not showing symptoms, but who have had close contact with an individual who has tested positively for COVID-19, wait five to seven days after the known exposure to get a COVID-19 test. Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."
						},
						{
							"question": "Do I need a doctor’s referral to be tested for COVID-19 at a MedExpress center?",
							"answer": "No, you do not need a referral from your doctor to be tested. Please note, however, that COVID-19 testing is only available at designated MedExpress COVID-19 testing locations for patients who are seen and evaluated at our centers. We do not currently accept referrals or prescriptions for testing from outside health care providers."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer a telehealth option?",
							"answer": "Yes, MedExpress is proud to offer patients the option of a Virtual Visit. Speak with one of our providers from the comfort of your home with secure video conferencing. All appointments subject to availability. Patients must be physically located in states where service offering is available in order to utilize this service. Please be advised that some illnesses and injuries are more appropriately treated in-person, and you may be asked to visit a MedExpress center in-person or directed to another health care provider or facility, when appropriate.

						},
						{
							"question": "How much does a typical visit to MedExpress cost?",
							"answer": "The cost of a visit to MedExpress varies based on the services you receive and the specifics of your insurance plan. MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs and also offers affordable pricing for those without insurance."
						},
						{
							"question": "What insurance does MedExpress accept?",
							"answer": "MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs, but in-network plans can vary by location. For additional information regarding your specific plan and coverage, such as co-pays, deductibles, or co-insurance, please contact your insurance provider directly."

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat patients of all ages, including infants?",
							"answer": "MedExpress’ providers will evaluate and treat patients of all ages, including infants. Depending on the presenting symptoms, infants need to be directed for further evaluation, but our team of clinicians can help to determine the best plan of treatment. While MedExpress will evaluate anyone – regardless of age – who visits one of our centers, our providers may decline to treat infants (6 months or younger) and refer them back to their pediatrician or ER, where they can receive the best possible care."
						},

							"answer": "MedExpress treats a wide variety of injuries and illnesses, including sprains, flu, skin ailments – such as poison ivy and cellulitis – urinary tract infections, strep throat and more.

For a complete list of all our offerings, please visit our website."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer vaccines and immunizations?",
							"answer": "MedExpress offers many immunizations for adults, including the flu vaccine and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough vaccine); however, there are some regional variances in vaccine availability. It’s always best to call your local center first to see if the immunization you’re looking for is in stock. As for children, MedExpress does not provide routine child immunizations with the exception of annual flu shots (for children ages 4 and older) and tetanus shots (if needed due to an injury)."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat dental issues, such as tooth aches?",
							"answer": "For dental pain and tooth aches, our providers can evaluate you and may prescribe antibiotics, if needed. From there, we can refer you to a dentist, as they are the best professionals to consult for any dental needs."
						},

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat chronic conditions, such as diabetes?",
							"answer": "Our full medical team will gladly evaluate anyone in need of medical care and help decide the best plan of treatment. However, chronic medical conditions are best handled by a PCP, who can offer a long-term treatment plan. It’s always important to remember that if you think you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately."
						},

						},

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer STD/STI testing?",
							"answer": "MedExpress can provide initial STD testing at all of our locations."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress make referrals to other healthcare providers?",
							"answer": "Yes. MedExpress can help with referrals to other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, specialists, and primary care physicians (PCPs), after treating you as a patient. We want to make sure our patients get the follow-up care they need. However, it’s important to know that we’re only able to provide referrals if our provider deems it appropriate for the patient’s condition."
						},

							"question": "What types of COVID-19 testing does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is offering COVID-19 evaluations and testing at designated centers to help support our local communities' health care needs amid the pandemic. In order to ensure individuals receive the highest-quality care and treatment, all individuals seeking care at MedExpress for known or suspected COVID-19 cases will receive an examination by a MedExpress health care professional who will determine if testing is needed and which testing method may be most appropriate, including rapid antigen and laboratory send-out PCR COVID-19 testing. \n\nPlease note that for the most accurate COVID-19 test results, the CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that individuals who are not showing symptoms, but who have had close contact with an individual who has tested positively for COVID-19, wait five to seven days after the known exposure to get a COVID-19 test. Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."
						},
						{
							"question": "Do I need a doctor’s referral to be tested for COVID-19 at a MedExpress center?",
							"answer": "No, you do not need a referral from your doctor to be tested. Please note, however, that COVID-19 testing is only available at designated MedExpress COVID-19 testing locations for patients who are seen and evaluated at our centers. We do not currently accept referrals or prescriptions for testing from outside health care providers."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer a telehealth option?",
							"answer": "Yes, MedExpress is proud to offer patients the option of a Virtual Visit. Speak with one of our providers from the comfort of your home with secure video conferencing. All appointments subject to availability. Patients must be physically located in states where service offering is available in order to utilize this service. Please be advised that some illnesses and injuries are more appropriately treated in-person, and you may be asked to visit a MedExpress center in-person or directed to another health care provider or facility, when appropriate.

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat dental issues, such as tooth aches?",

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat chronic conditions, such as diabetes?",
							"answer": "Our full medical team will gladly evaluate anyone in need of medical care and help decide the best plan of treatment.

In order to ensure individuals receive the highest-quality care and treatment, all individuals seeking care at MedExpress for known or suspected COVID-19 cases will receive an examination by a MedExpress health care professional who will determine if testing is needed and which testing method may be most appropriate, including rapid antigen and laboratory send-out PCR COVID-19 testing. \n\nPlease note that for the most accurate COVID-19 test results, the CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that individuals who are not showing symptoms, but who have had close contact with an individual who has tested positively for COVID-19, wait five to seven days after the known exposure to get a COVID-19 test. Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."
						},

We do not currently accept referrals or prescriptions for testing from outside health care providers."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer a telehealth option?",
							"answer": "Yes, MedExpress is proud to offer patients the option of a Virtual Visit. Speak with one of our providers from the comfort of your home with secure video conferencing. All appointments subject to availability. Patients must be physically located in states where service offering is available in order to utilize this service.

In order to ensure individuals receive the highest-quality care and treatment, all individuals seeking care at MedExpress for known or suspected COVID-19 cases will receive an examination by a MedExpress health care professional who will determine if testing is needed and which testing method may be most appropriate, including rapid antigen and laboratory send-out PCR COVID-19 testing. \n\nPlease note that for the most accurate COVID-19 test results, the CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that individuals who are not showing symptoms, but who have had close contact with an individual who has tested positively for COVID-19, wait five to seven days after the known exposure to get a COVID-19 test. Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."

We do not currently accept referrals or prescriptions for testing from outside health care providers."

Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."

Depending on the presenting symptoms, infants need to be directed for further evaluation, but our team of clinicians can help to determine the best plan of treatment.

							"answer": "MedExpress treats a wide variety of injuries and illnesses, including sprains, flu, skin ailments – such as poison ivy and cellulitis – urinary tract infections, strep throat and more.

As for children, MedExpress does not provide routine child immunizations with the exception of annual flu shots (for children ages 4 and older) and tetanus shots (if needed due to an injury)."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat dental issues, such as tooth aches?",

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat chronic conditions, such as diabetes?",
							"answer": "Our full medical team will gladly evaluate anyone in need of medical care and help decide the best plan of treatment. However, chronic medical conditions are best handled by a PCP, who can offer a long-term treatment plan. It’s always important to remember that if you think you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately."

						},

							"answer": "MedExpress can provide initial STD testing at all of our locations."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress make referrals to other healthcare providers?",
							"answer": "Yes. MedExpress can help with referrals to other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, specialists, and primary care physicians (PCPs), after treating you as a patient.

However, it’s important to know that we’re only able to provide referrals if our provider deems it appropriate for the patient’s condition."
						},
						{

							"question": "What types of COVID-19 testing does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is offering COVID-19 evaluations and testing at designated centers to help support our local communities' health care needs amid the pandemic. In order to ensure individuals receive the highest-quality care and treatment, all individuals seeking care at MedExpress for known or suspected COVID-19 cases will receive an examination by a MedExpress health care professional who will determine if testing is needed and which testing method may be most appropriate, including rapid antigen and laboratory send-out PCR COVID-19 testing. \n\nPlease note that for the most accurate COVID-19 test results, the CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that individuals who are not showing symptoms, but who have had close contact with an individual who has tested positively for COVID-19, wait five to seven days after the known exposure to get a COVID-19 test. Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."
						},
						{
							"question": "Do I need a doctor’s referral to be tested for COVID-19 at a MedExpress center?",

We do not currently accept referrals or prescriptions for testing from outside health care providers."

						},
						{
							"question": "How much does a typical visit to MedExpress cost?",
							"answer": "The cost of a visit to MedExpress varies based on the services you receive and the specifics of your insurance plan. MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs and also offers affordable pricing for those without insurance."
						},
						{
							"question": "What insurance does MedExpress accept?",
							"answer": "MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs, but in-network plans can vary by location. For additional information regarding your specific plan and coverage, such as co-pays, deductibles, or co-insurance, please contact your insurance provider directly."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can I still visit MedExpress if I don’t have insurance?",

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat patients of all ages, including infants?",
							"answer": "MedExpress’ providers will evaluate and treat patients of all ages, including infants. Depending on the presenting symptoms, infants need to be directed for further evaluation, but our team of clinicians can help to determine the best plan of treatment. While MedExpress will evaluate anyone – regardless of age – who visits one of our centers, our providers may decline to treat infants (6 months or younger) and refer them back to their pediatrician or ER, where they can receive the best possible care."
						},
						{
							"question": "What type of services and treatment options does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress treats a wide variety of injuries and illnesses, including sprains, flu, skin ailments – such as poison ivy and cellulitis – urinary tract infections, strep throat and more. Our centers have the necessary equipment onsite to provide top quality care.

For a complete list of all our offerings, please visit our website."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer vaccines and immunizations?",
							"answer": "MedExpress offers many immunizations for adults, including the flu vaccine and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough vaccine); however, there are some regional variances in vaccine availability. It’s always best to call your local center first to see if the immunization you’re looking for is in stock. As for children, MedExpress does not provide routine child immunizations with the exception of annual flu shots (for children ages 4 and older) and tetanus shots (if needed due to an injury)."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat dental issues, such as tooth aches?",
							"answer": "For dental pain and tooth aches, our providers can evaluate you and may prescribe antibiotics, if needed. From there, we can refer you to a dentist, as they are the best professionals to consult for any dental needs."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress conduct eye examinations?",
							"answer": "Our providers do not prescribe glasses or contacts. However, our full medical team can help with eye-related illness or injuries, such as pink eye. If further specialized treatment is needed, we can refer you to an eye specialist."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat chronic conditions, such as diabetes?",
							"answer": "Our full medical team will gladly evaluate anyone in need of medical care and help decide the best plan of treatment. However, chronic medical conditions are best handled by a PCP, who can offer a long-term treatment plan. It’s always important to remember that if you think you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer physicals?",
							"answer": "MedExpress provides convenient and affordable physicals for a variety of reasons, including school physicals, sports physicals, daycare physicals, DOT physicals and work-related physicals.

						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide mental health services?",
							"answer": "If you’ve visited us as a patient, MedExpress can help make a mental health referral for new symptoms, but we also encourage you to reach out to community resources. If you have insurance, the 1-800 number on the back of your card will connect you with someone who can help with in-network referrals."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide gynecology care?",
							"answer": "MedExpress does not provide routine gynecological or OB care, which includes conducting ultrasounds and prescribing birth control. However, we can conduct pregnancy testing after a medical evaluation and provide medical treatment to pregnant women who are being seen for a minor illness or injury."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer STD/STI testing?",
							"answer": "MedExpress can provide initial STD testing at all of our locations."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress make referrals to other healthcare providers?",
							"answer": "Yes. MedExpress can help with referrals to other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, specialists, and primary care physicians (PCPs), after treating you as a patient. We want to make sure our patients get the follow-up care they need. However, it’s important to know that we’re only able to provide referrals if our provider deems it appropriate for the patient’s condition."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can MedExpress write prescription refills?",
							"answer": "Prescriptions require a visit with one of our providers, and we may potentially prescribe limited prescription refills. However, we cannot provide refill prescriptions for controlled substances or birth control."
						},
						{
							"question": "What types of COVID-19 testing does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is offering COVID-19 evaluations and testing at designated centers to help support our local communities' health care needs amid the pandemic. In order to ensure individuals receive the highest-quality care and treatment, all individuals seeking care at MedExpress for known or suspected COVID-19 cases will receive an examination by a MedExpress health care professional who will determine if testing is needed and which testing method may be most appropriate, including rapid antigen and laboratory send-out PCR COVID-19 testing. \n\nPlease note that for the most accurate COVID-19 test results, the CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that individuals who are not showing symptoms, but who have had close contact with an individual who has tested positively for COVID-19, wait five to seven days after the known exposure to get a COVID-19 test. Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."
						},
						{
							"question": "Do I need a doctor’s referral to be tested for COVID-19 at a MedExpress center?",
							"answer": "No, you do not need a referral from your doctor to be tested. Please note, however, that COVID-19 testing is only available at designated MedExpress COVID-19 testing locations for patients who are seen and evaluated at our centers. We do not currently accept referrals or prescriptions for testing from outside health care providers."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer a telehealth option?",
							"answer": "Yes, MedExpress is proud to offer patients the option of a Virtual Visit. Speak with one of our providers from the comfort of your home with secure video conferencing. All appointments subject to availability. Patients must be physically located in states where service offering is available in order to utilize this service. Please be advised that some illnesses and injuries are more appropriately treated in-person, and you may be asked to visit a MedExpress center in-person or directed to another health care provider or facility, when appropriate. Please visit our website to learn more about this offering."

						{
							"question": "When is MedExpress open?",
							"answer": "Our centers are open from 8-8 every day, no appointment necessary, except for a few holidays to give our team members the opportunity to spend time with family and friends. We recommend that you visit our website to check your nearest center's listing for exact hours before visiting."
						},
						{
							"question": "How much does a typical visit to MedExpress cost?",
							"answer": "The cost of a visit to MedExpress varies based on the services you receive and the specifics of your insurance plan. MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs and also offers affordable pricing for those without insurance."
						},
						{
							"question": "What insurance does MedExpress accept?",
							"answer": "MedExpress accepts most major insurance plans to help patients avoid out-of-network costs, but in-network plans can vary by location. For additional information regarding your specific plan and coverage, such as co-pays, deductibles, or co-insurance, please contact your insurance provider directly."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can I still visit MedExpress if I don’t have insurance?",
							"answer": "Yes. For those without insurance, self-pay services start at $119 - $139. The price of self-pay services will depend on where your center is located."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress accept VA benefits?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is proud to be a VA authorized urgent care provider. If you opt for self-pay, you will be required to pay at the time of your visit either with cash, check, debit card or credit card. At this time, MedExpress does not accept CareCredit."
						},

							"question": "How do I pay my bill?",
							"answer": "You can pay your bill online by visiting our Bill Pay Portal on our website. You’ll need to know your quick pay code, which is located on your patient statement at the top right of the page. For more details or to direct questions to our customer service department, please visit the Pay My Bill section on our website."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat patients of all ages, including infants?",
							"answer": "MedExpress’ providers will evaluate and treat patients of all ages, including infants. Depending on the presenting symptoms, infants need to be directed for further evaluation, but our team of clinicians can help to determine the best plan of treatment. While MedExpress will evaluate anyone – regardless of age – who visits one of our centers, our providers may decline to treat infants (6 months or younger) and refer them back to their pediatrician or ER, where they can receive the best possible care."
						},
						{
							"question": "What type of services and treatment options does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress treats a wide variety of injuries and illnesses, including sprains, flu, skin ailments – such as poison ivy and cellulitis – urinary tract infections, strep throat and more. Our centers have the necessary equipment onsite to provide top quality care. If deemed necessary, our medical professionals can complete X-rays, laboratory services (such as strep tests and urinalysis), EKGs, stitches and more. For a complete list of all our offerings, please visit our website."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer vaccines and immunizations?",
							"answer": "MedExpress offers many immunizations for adults, including the flu vaccine and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough vaccine); however, there are some regional variances in vaccine availability. It’s always best to call your local center first to see if the immunization you’re looking for is in stock. As for children, MedExpress does not provide routine child immunizations with the exception of annual flu shots (for children ages 4 and older) and tetanus shots (if needed due to an injury)."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat dental issues, such as tooth aches?",
							"answer": "For dental pain and tooth aches, our providers can evaluate you and may prescribe antibiotics, if needed. From there, we can refer you to a dentist, as they are the best professionals to consult for any dental needs."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress conduct eye examinations?",
							"answer": "Our providers do not prescribe glasses or contacts. However, our full medical team can help with eye-related illness or injuries, such as pink eye. If further specialized treatment is needed, we can refer you to an eye specialist."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress treat chronic conditions, such as diabetes?",
							"answer": "Our full medical team will gladly evaluate anyone in need of medical care and help decide the best plan of treatment. However, chronic medical conditions are best handled by a PCP, who can offer a long-term treatment plan. It’s always important to remember that if you think you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer physicals?",
							"answer": "MedExpress provides convenient and affordable physicals for a variety of reasons, including school physicals, sports physicals, daycare physicals, DOT physicals and work-related physicals. Please visit our website for specific information related to your needs and availability in your area."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide mental health services?",
							"answer": "If you’ve visited us as a patient, MedExpress can help make a mental health referral for new symptoms, but we also encourage you to reach out to community resources. If you have insurance, the 1-800 number on the back of your card will connect you with someone who can help with in-network referrals."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress provide gynecology care?",
							"answer": "MedExpress does not provide routine gynecological or OB care, which includes conducting ultrasounds and prescribing birth control. However, we can conduct pregnancy testing after a medical evaluation and provide medical treatment to pregnant women who are being seen for a minor illness or injury."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer STD/STI testing?",
							"answer": "MedExpress can provide initial STD testing at all of our locations."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress make referrals to other healthcare providers?",
							"answer": "Yes. MedExpress can help with referrals to other healthcare providers, such as hospitals, specialists, and primary care physicians (PCPs), after treating you as a patient. We want to make sure our patients get the follow-up care they need. However, it’s important to know that we’re only able to provide referrals if our provider deems it appropriate for the patient’s condition."
						},
						{
							"question": "Can MedExpress write prescription refills?",
							"answer": "Prescriptions require a visit with one of our providers, and we may potentially prescribe limited prescription refills. However, we cannot provide refill prescriptions for controlled substances or birth control."
						},
						{
							"question": "What types of COVID-19 testing does MedExpress offer?",
							"answer": "MedExpress is offering COVID-19 evaluations and testing at designated centers to help support our local communities' health care needs amid the pandemic. In order to ensure individuals receive the highest-quality care and treatment, all individuals seeking care at MedExpress for known or suspected COVID-19 cases will receive an examination by a MedExpress health care professional who will determine if testing is needed and which testing method may be most appropriate, including rapid antigen and laboratory send-out PCR COVID-19 testing. \n\nPlease note that for the most accurate COVID-19 test results, the CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend that individuals who are not showing symptoms, but who have had close contact with an individual who has tested positively for COVID-19, wait five to seven days after the known exposure to get a COVID-19 test. Additionally, the CDC and AAFP recommend self-quarantining for 14 days after a known exposure to COVID-19, even if no symptoms are present."
						},
						{
							"question": "Do I need a doctor’s referral to be tested for COVID-19 at a MedExpress center?",
							"answer": "No, you do not need a referral from your doctor to be tested. Please note, however, that COVID-19 testing is only available at designated MedExpress COVID-19 testing locations for patients who are seen and evaluated at our centers. We do not currently accept referrals or prescriptions for testing from outside health care providers."
						},
						{
							"question": "Does MedExpress offer a telehealth option?",
							"answer": "Yes, MedExpress is proud to offer patients the option of a Virtual Visit. Speak with one of our providers from the comfort of your home with secure video conferencing. All appointments subject to availability. Patients must be physically located in states where service offering is available in order to utilize this service. Please be advised that some illnesses and injuries are more appropriately treated in-person, and you may be asked to visit a MedExpress center in-person or directed to another health care provider or facility, when appropriate. Please visit our website to learn more about this offering."
